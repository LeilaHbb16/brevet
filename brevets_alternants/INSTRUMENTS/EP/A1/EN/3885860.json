One of the main factors is soiling, i.e. photovoltaic modules such as strings or panels getting dirty and by this reducing the irradiation that reaches the solar cell. Further effect is the slow degradation of the solar plant due to aging.", "[0004]    The detection of photovoltaic power generation losses and the differentiation, whether these are remediable or due to long term aging, is key aspect of detecting power production degradation of solar power plants. The remediable losses, like soiling, can be easily fixed by maintenance actions like cleaning of the modules, strings or panels, thus reducing the losses.", "[0005]    Typically for solar respectively photovoltaic plants, according to a prior art disclosed in [1], is the performance ratio computed for a given period, e.g. day, week, month. This is achieved by dividing the produced energy of the solar or photovoltaic plant by the energy received from the sun, which is normalized to Standard test Conditions (STC) over the period. This is a good indication of the performance, but typically a variability of 5 to 10 % of the performance ratio can be observed, or even more, due to different issues such as availability of the plant, external factors such as temperature, level of irradiation, accuracy of Maximum Power Point (MPP) tracking and soiling. This variability prohibits the detection of effects like soiling and degradation of the plant.", "[0006]    Other approaches are based on the comparison of the plant production with other plants in the region. This is a source of information for the performance evaluation of the plant.", "[0007]    Another approach is the use of satellite data. Typically, these are used in the planning phase in the form of a \"Typical Meteorological Year (TMY)\", e.g. the label sizes P50, P90). There are also approaches to replace the local irradiation measurements with satellite data in the performance computation during the operation.", "[0008]    For the detection of soiling the most common approach, according to a prior art disclosed in [1], is the use of local reference sensors. Such solutions either include manual cleaning of reference sensors or they require hardware solutions where the cleaning is automated and/or performed by robots. These solutions are expensive because they require manual effort and/or additional hardware, and further on hardware mechanical solutions are susceptible to damage.", "[0009]    It is an objective of the invention to propose a method, computer-implemented tool and power plant control device for detecting power production degradation of solar power plants as well as a solar power plant system, by which the detection of power production degradation, affected for instance by long term aging or soiling of at least one photovoltaic module of the solar power plant, is automated and carried out sensor-less.", "[0010]    This objective is solved based on a method defined in the preamble of claim 1 or 2 by the features in the characterizing part of claim 1 or 2.", "[0011]    The objective is further solved based on a computer-implemented tool defined in the preamble of claim 9 or 10 by the features in the characterizing part of claim 9 or 10.", "[0012]    The objective is solved furthermore based on a power plant control device defined in the preamble of claim 17 by the features in the characterizing part of claim 17.", "[0013]    The objective is solved moreover based on a solar power plant defined in the preamble of claim 18 by the features in the characterizing part of claim 18.", "[0014]    The main idea of the invention for detecting power production degradation of a solar power plant with at least one photovoltaic module according to the claims 1, 2, 9, 10, 17 and 18 is to determine the degradation by calibrating local measurements of data related to module/plant-internal parameters such as irradiance and temperature (cf. claims 1 and 9) or electric power and temperature (cf. claims 2 and 10) as measurement data against irradiance reference data for instance satellite data in the form of weather data for the same time and then analyze a variation of the calibration.", "[0015]    This calibration operation includes the following three steps:\n1. Collecting the cited data in time series, e.g. during a recurring, in particular periodic, time interval, and storing them, preferably in a database.\nIn particular the following data or information are collected:\nAlternate Current (AC) power information/data of the solar power plant measured with a local power meter.\nPower measurement information from every measured power source of the solar power plant, e.g. inverter, photovoltaic string or module.\nControl actions information on the solar power plant, e.g. curtailment, operation mode if available.\nLocal Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and/or Plan Of Array Irradiance (POA) for each field of the solar power plant measured by local sensors, wherein all panels in one field are assumed to have same orientation and with the panel as an array of photovoltaic modules (cf. claims 6 and 14).\nTemperature information measured on the back of each panel for each field.\nSatellite based meteorological information for the solar power plant as the irradiance reference data for instance: Local Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and/or Plan of Array Irradiance (POA), which is received preferably from a data provider.\n2. Selecting a time period and estimating, preferably by computing, model factors of an equivalence model by calculating an equivalence function to determine a model equivalence between at least the local irradiation measurements or at least power measurements and the preferred satellite-based irradiance reference data, which is performed for a time period regularly over numerous time periods with equal or variable time durations. Such a time period can be e.g. one day up to one week.\nFor each time period the following processing is executed or performed either optionally or mandatorily:\n- Optionally, as an advantageous development of the invention according to claims 3 and 11 time periods with bad data are eliminated. Such eliminations relate to\n-- time periods when there are outages of the solar power plant or power curtailment of the solar power plant due to control actions.This can be done either by directly evaluating control signal-based operational metadata from the solar power plant or a photovoltaic site, if available, or by comparing the produced power of the solar power plant to the measured irradiation.\n-- synchronization issues, e.g. between irradiation and electric power measurements, and \"maximum-power-point (MPP)\"-tracking issues by detecting clear sky conditions and then keeping only the periods with clear sky. Methods for clear sky detections are known from the state of the art, e.g. [3]. This has a quite important effect on the model stabilization.\n- Mandatorily, estimating a temperature compensation factor, an irradiance compensation factor and a variability compensation factor (cf. claims 1 and 9) or a temperature compensation factor, an electric power compensation factor and a variability compensation factor (cf. claims 2 and 10) by imposing each that the compensated equivalence between the local measurements and the preferred satellite-based irradiance reference data remains stable, which means that the temperature and the irradiation compensation parameters respectively the temperature and the electric power compensation parameters remain the same over the lifetime of the plant, whereas the only variable parameter is the variability compensation factor, being preferably according to the claims 5 and 13 a proportionality factor, which is influenced by soling and slow degradation of the sensors and the photovoltaic modules, strings or panels.The estimation of the compensation factors can be calculated advantageously by a linear function as the equivalence function according to the claims 7 and 15 referring to the estimation of the temperature compensation factor, the irradiance compensation factor and the variability compensation factor and according to the claims 8 and 16 referring to the estimation of the temperature compensation factor, the electric power compensation factor and the variability compensation factor.\n3. Detecting soiling and long-term degradation. This is done by evaluation the evolution of the variability compensation factor respectively the proportionality factor in the form a trend analysis.\nSo variations that fall back from time to time to the same value (long term trend) are due to soiling that gets cleaned due to rain or service cleaning. This builds up to several percentage variation compared with the long-term variations which should be around 1% or less per year.", "[0016]    Further long-term variations are typically due to slow degradation of the solar power plant or the photovoltaic modules, strings or panels. So slow variation over years can indicate degradation of these devices.", "[0017]    These effects are visualized in  FIGURE 4 . So, soiling during weeks/months will lead to an increase of the variability compensation factor respectively the proportionality factor and it has jumps in case of cleaning/rain.", "[0018]    The computation outlined above can be performed for the entire solar power plant, at the inverter and on the level of the photovoltaic modules, strings or panels.", "[0019]    The calibration step of the different environmental influences, including the selection of clear sky conditions for the calibration mentioned above is the key aspect of differentiating the current invention report from those approaches introduced in the introductory part of the application.", "[0020]    The differentiation to these approaches is the comparison and calibration of the satellite-based irradiation reference data with the local measurements and identification of jumps in case of cleaning/rain to discriminate soiling from other long-term degradation effects.", "[0021]    The benefits of the proposed digital solution concerning the problem initially discussed are the robustness and the inexpensiveness of the approach outlined above in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches using the support of sensors for indicating a manual cleaning or a cleaning with mechanical devices. The cost reduction by detecting when cleaning is needed and by this avoiding unneeded service costs is given by the fact that it is advantageous according to claims 4 and 12 to generate a time information for initiating an action to counter the power production degradation such as the cleaning necessity of the photovoltaic modules, strings or panels due to soiling as result of evaluating the evolution of the variability compensation factor respectively the proportionality factor in the form a trend analysis.", "[0022]    Moreover, advantageous further developments of the invention arise out of the following description of a preferred embodiment of the invention according to  FIGURES 1 to 4 .

This is done by evaluation the evolution of the variability compensation factor respectively the proportionality factor in the form of the cited trend analysis:\nSo variations that fall back from time to time to the same value (long term trend) are due to soiling that gets cleaned due to rain or service cleaning. This builds up to several percentage variation compared with the long-term variations which should be around 1% or less per year.\nLong-term variations are typically due to slow degradation of the solar power plant or the photovoltaic modules, strings or panels. So slow variation over years indicate degradation of the solar power plant itself or the cited components.", "[0063]    These effects are visualized in the  FIGURE 4 .
